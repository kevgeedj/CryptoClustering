# Cryptocurrency Clustering

By applying advanced data analysis techniques, this approach helps identify trends, similarities, and differences among digital currencies, providing valuable insights for investors, researchers, and enthusiasts in the cryptocurrency space. K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to achieve this.

# Methods

- Dimensionality Reduction: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving the most significant information. This step helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and enhance computational efficiency.

- Clustering: Employ clustering algorithms, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to group similar cryptocurrencies together based on the selected features. This step helps in identifying underlying patterns and potential diversification opportunities within the cryptocurrency market.
